THIS IS IMPORTANT!
------------------

Before building the Docker image you have to modify the user and password in
the file edit_these_files/mom.ini!  Please ask the LOFAR software support team
to provide you with proper user credentials.  Please  direct your inquiry to
<softwaresupport@astron.nl>.

Be aware that sharing your Docker image will result in sharing your MoM
credentials!
